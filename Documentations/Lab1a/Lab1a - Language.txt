if, while, then, else, from, as follows, with - Reserved Keywords
then is used at the end of a condition
// is used in order to start a comment
. is used to tell the compiler it reached the end of a command
, is used to:
	- separate commands that should all be executed inside the same block of text
	- separate elements in an array.
.vcl would be a very cool file extension

p1) Find the maximum out of 3 numbers
void maxThree with int a, int b, int c as follows
	largest = 0.
	if a >= b && a >= c then
		largest = a.
	if b >= a && b >= c then
		largest = b.
	if c >= a && c >= b then
		largest = c.
	print largest..

p2) Verify if a number is prime
void checkPrime with int n as follows
	ok = 0.
	d = 2.
	while d <= n/2 && ok == 0 then
		if n % d == 0 then
			ok = 1.,
		d += 1.
	if ok == 0 then
		print "n is a prime number.
	else
		print "n is NOT a prime number"..

p3) Compute the maximum of n numbers.
void maxArray with array A, int n as follows
	i = 0.
	biggest = 0.
	while i < n then
		if i from A > biggest then
			biggest = i from A.,
		i += 1.
	print biggest.

p1err) Find the maximum out of 3 numbers
# int c is not part of the arguments of the function as in not defined
# $$ are present next to follows
# at the third if statement we have th and not then
void maxThree with int a, int b as follows$$
	if a >= b && a >= c then
		largest = a.
	if b >= a && b >= c then
		largest = b.
	if c >= a && c >= b th
		largest = c.
	print largest..
