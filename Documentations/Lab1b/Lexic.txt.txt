		The rule is:
			identifier := letter | letter {letter} {digit}
			letter := "A" | "B" | ... | "Z"
			digit := "0" | "1" | ... | "9"
	c. Constants
		i.    Integer with the rule:
			non_zero_digit := "1" | "2" | ... | "9"
			signed := "0" | ["+"|"-"] non_zero_digit {digit}
			unsigned := non_zero_digit {digit}
		ii.   Character with the rule:
			character = 'letter' | 'digit' | "_"
		iii.  String with the rule:
			constantchar := "string"
			string := char{string}
			char := letter | digit | "_"
